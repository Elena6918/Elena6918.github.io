I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Virginia, advised by
<a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/">Professor David Evans</a> in the
<a href="https://uvasrg.github.io/">Security Research Group</a>.
My research focuses on **systematic evaluation and empirical analysis of security- and privacy-critical systems**, with an emphasis on understanding when claimed guarantees break down in real-world settings.

Across my work, I have been consistently interested in the gap between **what systems are designed or claimed to do** and **how they actually behave in practice**. Early in my research, this led me to large-scale empirical studies of online platforms and web privacy protocols, where formal guarantees often rely on assumptions that are difficult to validate after deployment. Later, while studying audio-visual deepfake detection, I became increasingly aware that strong benchmark performance does not necessarily imply that a model has learned the semantic properties we expect, which further shaped my focus on evaluation methodology and failure analysis.

More recently, my work has centered on the evolution of host-based intrusion detection system, where security knowledge itself changes over time in response to adversaries, data drift, and engineering constraints. Through this lens, I study how detection rules are authored, modified, and revised in practice, and what these changes reveal about detection effectiveness, evaluation blind spots, and long-term maintainability.


I am **actively seeking research internships** and **full-time roles** where I can apply empirical evaluation and security analysis to real systems and datasets, working closely with engineering and threat assessment teams to surface actionable insights. I am particularly interested in industrial research roles that emphasize security effectiveness, detection efficacy, trustworthy system evaluation, and empirical analysis of complex deployed systems.
