I am a fourth-year Computer Science PhD candidate at the University of Virginia, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href='https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/'>Professor David Evans</a> in <a href='https://uvasrg.github.io/'>Security Research Group</a>. My research and work experience reflect my openness to a broad range of projects aimed at enhancing computer security and safeguarding user privacy in an increasingly data-driven world. I was supervised by <a href='https://www.ytian.info/'>Professor Yuan Tian</a> for my undergraduate research. My past research includes analyzing code to find vulnerable patterns, examining online platforms to address privacy issues, and building privacy-preserving systems. 

My Chinese name is written as 龙玟君, and I go by Elena in my daily life. I drew my self-portrait on the right with <a href='https://procreate.com/'>Procreate</a>, celebrating the Year of the Snake (2025).
