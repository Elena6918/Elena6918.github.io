I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student University of Virginia. I am advised by <a href='https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/'>Professor Dave Evans</a> in <a href='https://uvasrg.github.io/'>Security Research Group</a>. I am broadly interested in research topics related to security and privacy, including but not limited to application security, network security, and data privacy. My past research includes analyzing code to find vulnerable patterns, examining online platforms to address privacy issues, and building privacy-preserving systems. I am currently working on privacy in ad ecosystem.

My Chinese name is written as 龙玟君, and I go by Elena in my daily life. I drew my self-portrait on the right with <a href='https://procreate.com/'>Procreate</a>. The ears are for the celebration the Year of the Tiger (2022).
